This repository contains my AY 101 Creative Project.

The goal of this project was to give viewers a better understanding of The Solar System. This website contains three different, fundamental facts
about our Solar System. First, it gives viewers a better understanding of the orbital speeds of the planets around The Sun. Second, it gives viewers
an idea of how large each planet and The Sun are in comparison to each other. Third, it gives viewers insight into how far each planet is from each other.

All in all, I really enjoyed creating this project, and I hope that future students will find it useful in gaining an understanding of our Solar System!
